# abfe_restraints

This repo consists of a very simple text file which is valid Mathematica (Wolfram Language) input. It provides example input to carry out the calculations described in the preprint available at https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-8s9dz-v2. The purpose of the manuscript (and this sample code) is to compare the results obtained for the restraint correction terms published by Chen et al. (DOI:10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00013) with the much simpler expressions by Boresch et al. (DOI: 10.1021/jp0217839).
